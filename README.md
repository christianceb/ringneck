# Ringneck

(Ringneck is currently mothballed due to changing life circumstances.)

**Ringneck** is a pet project designed to help me with budgeting where I was paid monthly, but the bills come in weekly, fortnightly, or even every 28 days.

Problem statement: you get paid on January, and you pay rent every fortnight. You see that in January, you need to save for two fortnights to be able to pay rent. February comes in, same thing. March, April, etc. Next thing you know, a month comes in, but for some reason you have to save for three fortnights! then you wonder how did this happen?!

Ringneck's purpose is to tell you how much money should you save so if you are hit with a "triple" like the problem statement, you will have enough money to pay for it without having it feel like rip a part of your life out!
